# Conventional Commits

## Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

| Type | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | Adding a new feature (MINOR in SemVer) |
| `fix` | Patching a bug (PATCH in SemVer) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, no code change |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies |
| `ci` | CI configuration |
| `chore` | Other changes (maintenance, tooling) |

## Scope

Optional. Use a noun describing the affected area in parentheses: `feat(auth):`, `fix(api):`.

## Examples

```
feat: add user registration endpoint
```

```
fix(login): prevent redirect loop on session expiry
```

```
chore(hooks): rename run-quality-checks to run-phpstan-on-stop
```

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

```
feat(api)!: drop support for deprecated endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: /v1/users has been removed. Use /v2/users instead.
```

## Rules

- Description is required and MUST immediately follow the type/scope.
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature".
- No period at the end of the description.
- Use `!` after type/scope or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer for breaking changes.
