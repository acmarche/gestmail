# Code formatters & refactors (auto-updating tools)

These tools modify code automatically. Run them before finalizing changes so the codebase stays consistent.

## Rector

- Run `vendor/bin/rector --ansi` before finalizing changes so refactoring rules are applied.
- Rector updates code on its own; run it to keep the codebase aligned with configured rules.
